# HTML Images, CSS Color & Text

## HTML Media

### Images in HTML

> - Use the `<img>` element to put a simple image on a webpage. This is an empty element (meaning that it has no text content or closing tag) that requires a minimum of one attribute to be useful â€” src (sometimes spoken as its full title, source). The src attribute contains a path pointing to the image you want to embed in the page, which can be a relative or absolute URL, in the same way as href attribute values in `<a>` elements. E.g. `<img src="dinosaur.jpg">`.
> - Elements like `<img>` and `<video>` are sometimes referred to as replaced elements because the element's content and size are defined by an external resource (like an image or video file), not by the contents of the element itself.
> - Alternative text with the `alt` attribute: Its value is supposed to be a textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed.
>   - Helpful if the user is visually impaired, and is using a screen reader to read the web out to them. In fact, having alt text available to describe images is useful to most users.
> - You can use the `width` and `height` attributes to specify the width and height of your image.
> - Add `title` attributes to images, to provide further supporting information if needed. But this is not recommeneded due to accessibility issues.
> - Annotate images with figures and figure captions using the HTML5 `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements. These are created for exactly this purpose: to provide a semantic container for figures, and to clearly link the figure to the caption
>   - A figure doesn't have to be an image.
> - Use CSS to embed images into webpages with the CSS `background-image` property, and the other `background-*` properties, are used to control background image placement.

### Choosing an image format

> | Use | Best choice | Fallback choice | Note |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | Photograph | WebP or JPEG | JPEG | Photographs typically fare well with lossy compression. |
> | Icons | SVG, Lossless WebP, or PNG | PNG | use a lossless format to avoid loss of detail in a size-constrained image. |
> | Screenshots | Lossless WebP or PNG; JPEG if compression artifacts aren't a concern | PNG or JPEG; GIF for screenshots with low color counts | use a lossless format for screenshots to avoid compromising image quality under lossy compression |
> | Diagrams, drawings, and charts | SVG | PNG | SVG is the best choice for any image that can be represented using vector graphics |

### Review Questions

---

1. What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website? **The user is visually impaired and using a screen reader**
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document? **Use captions (with the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` HTML5 elements) and the `alt` text**
3. Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document. **The `figure` element is used to provide semantic container for figures, and to clearly link the figure to the caption.**
4. Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
    **`gif` is ideal for simple images or animations**
    **`svg` is best used for objects that must be drawn accurately at different sizes**
5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why? **Lossless WebP or PNG. Text easily becomes fuzzy and unclear under lossy compression.**

### Applying color to HTML elements using CSS

- CSS properties can apply color to the various things that are drawn in the elements, such as text, borders, etc.
- The `color` property defines the foreground color of an HTML element's content and the `background-color` property defines the element's background color.
- Text can have:
  - `color`
  - `background-color`
  - `test-shadow`
  - `text-decoration-color`
  - ` text-emphasis-color`
  - `caret-color`
- Boxes:
  - [Borders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Applying_color#borders)
  - `background-color`
  - `column-rule-color`
  - `outline-color`
- Borders:  A basic element border is a line drawn around the edges of the element's content.
  - `border-color`
  - `border-left-color`, `border-right-color`, `border-top-color`, `border-bottom-color`
  - `border-block-start-color`, `border-block-end-color`
  - `border-inline-start-color`, `border-inline-end-color`

### Fundamental text and font styling

> - Text content effectively behaves like a series of inline elements, being laid out on lines adjacent to one another, and not creating line breaks until the end of the line is reached, or unless you force a line break manually using the `<br>` element.
> - CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two categories: Font styles, Text layout styles.
> ([from MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals))

#### Fonts

- Color
- Font Famalies
  - Web safe fonts
  - Default fonts
  - Font Stacks
- Font size
- Font style, font weight, text transform, and text decoration
- Text drop shadows
  - Multiple shadows

#### Text layout

- Text alingment
- Line height
- Letter and word spacing
- [Other misc properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#other_properties_worth_looking_at)

#### Font shorthand

> - Many font properties can also be set through the shorthand property `font`. These are written in the following order: `font-style`, `font-variant`, `font-weight`, `font-stretch`, `font-size`, `line-height`, and `font-family`.
> - Among all those properties, only `font-size` and `font-family` are required when using the font shorthand property.
> - A forward slash has to be put in between the `font-size` and `line-height` properties.
