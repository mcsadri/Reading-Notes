# Hello, World

Hi! I'm Manuch. Pronounced something like: Maa-nootch. My pronouns are he/him/his. After working in tech for nearly 20 years I'm branching into software development. I'm nervous but excited for this journey.

## Growth Mindset:
Personally, I've never had much of a growth mindset. As someone with ADHD growth is change, and change with ADHD is incredibly hard. The inertia of standing still is difficult to overcome. This Code Fellows experience will be an uphill challenge, one I hope I can rise to meet. To do so I will need to be kind to myself:
- [ ] One day at a time. This is a marathon.
- [ ] It's okay to fail as long as I try again.
- [ ] It's supposed to be difficult, but I can do this.
