# Growth Mindset

Personally, I've never had much of a growth mindset. As someone with ADHD growth is change, and change with ADHD can be incredibly hard. The inertia of standing still is frequently difficult to overcome. This Code Fellows experience will be an uphill challenge, one I hope I can rise to meet. To do so I will need to be kind to myself:

- [ ] One day at a time. This is a marathon.
- [ ] It's okay to fail as long as I try again.
- [ ] It's supposed to be difficult, but I can do this.
