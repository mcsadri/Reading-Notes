## [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
    1. He's a computer scientist and one of the original authors of the HTTP specification, and creator of REST, a software architectural style.
2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
    1. Machines weren't designed to be used like that. Most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have the requirements to communicate with any machine. They just needed to talk to a small group of machines.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
    1. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
4. What does a `GET` do?
    1. Get a representation of the target resource’s state. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Semantics_of_HTTP_methods)
5. What does a `POST` do?
    1. Let the target resource process the representation enclosed in the request. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Semantics_of_HTTP_methods)
6. What does `PUT` do?
    1. Create or replace the state of the target resource with the state defined by the representation enclosed in the request.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Semantics_of_HTTP_methods)
7. What does `PATCH` do?
    1. Partially update resource’s state.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Semantics_of_HTTP_methods)

## API Keys

Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.
