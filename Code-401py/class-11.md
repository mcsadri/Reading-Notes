### [What is Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

- JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.
  - enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner
- JupyterLab can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters
  - Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing
- JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats

### [How to Use JupyterLab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5YyoCKxEOU)

- Basics:
  - Text, Code Consoles, & Terminals
    - terminals in jupiter provide full support for system shells on Mac Linux and PowerShell on Windows including programs like at vim or Emacs
  - Common Formats
    - all popular image formats are supported as standalone files and in notebooks
    - JSON files can be edited as cell outputs or searchable tree views
  - Jupyter Notebooks
    - 2 modes:
      - when a notebook opens = command mode
        - command mode is designed for easily navigating and changing the framework of your notebook
        press `00` to restart the kernel
      - edit mode:
        - press enter to edit the currently active cell
        - uses markdown for formatting
        use `y` to change cell format to code
    - Run menu

## Reading Questions

- What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?
  - Jupyter notebook only offers a very simple interface using which users can open notebooks, terminals, and text files. Jupyter lab offers a very interactive interface that includes notebooks, consoles, terminals, CSV editors, markdown editors, interactive maps, and more.

- What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?
  - It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation, etc. [What is NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html)

- Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.
