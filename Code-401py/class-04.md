# Classes and Objects, Recursion, & pytest

## Reading

### [Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)

Classes and Objects

> - Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity.
> - Objects get their variables and functions from classes.
> - Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

Accessing Object Variables

> - You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined).
> - However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class.

Accessing Object Functions

> - To access a function inside of an object you use notation similar to accessing a variable.

init()

> - The `__init__()` function, is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated. It's used for assigning values in a class.

### [Thinking Recursively](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/) (Optional:`Naive Recursion` is Naive section and beyond)

> - A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.
> - A recursive function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result.
> - All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.

Maintaining State:

> - When dealing with recursive functions, each recursive call has its own execution context, so to maintain state during recursion you have to either:
>   - Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current callâ€™s execution context
>   - Keep the state in global scope

## Review Questions

1. What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?

2. Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?

3. What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.
