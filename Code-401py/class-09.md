# Stacks and Queues

## [Stacks and Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html)

- A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
- Common terminology for a stack is
    - Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
    - Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
    - Top - This is the top of the stack.
    - Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
    - IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
