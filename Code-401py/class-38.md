### [React - Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

- In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.
- Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
- You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn’t change.
- While declaring a variable and using an if statement is a fine way to conditionally render a component, sometimes you might want to use a shorter syntax.
  - Inline If with Logical && Operator
  - Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator
- In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return `null` instead of its render output.
  - Returning `null` from a component’s render method does not affect the firing of the component’s lifecycle methods.
