## Reading Questions

- What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher, and how was it used historically?

- What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?

- How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cryptography.

- Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.
