1. Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.

2. How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?

3. In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis.

4. Based on the Rolling Dice Example, explain how you would simulate a dice roll using Python. Describe how you would use code to calculate the probability of rolling a specific number (e.g., the probability of rolling a 6) over a large number of trials.
