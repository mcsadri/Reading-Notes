- Tips for accing a programming interview:
  - Take a few mins to evaluate the problem, after asking clarifying questions, before digging into it verbally & visually.
    - *"Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”*
  - Write down the steps of the solution
    - You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.
  - Write pseudocode first
    - Write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work
  - Don't sweat the small stuff
    - If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.
  - Sit down. Be humble. Consider the following:
    - Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?
    - Do you treat the interviewer with respect?
    - How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?
    - Are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions?
    - Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?
    - Are you honest (especially about yourself)?
  - Come prepared.
    - There is no substitute for HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat)
  - Review your work.
    - Time permitting, review your code as you would in a peer review
    - Look for:
      - Algorithmic efficiency
      - Correctness
