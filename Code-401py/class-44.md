# Ethics in Tech

## Code of Ethics

### [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)

- The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ("the Code") expresses the conscience of the profession.
- The Code is not an algorithm for solving ethical problems; rather it serves as a basis for ethical decision-making.
- The entire computing profession benefits when the ethical decision-making process is accountable to and transparent to all stakeholders. Open discussions about ethical issues promote this accountability and transparency.

### [Software Engineering Code of Ethics](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code/)

- Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high sounding but empty.
- Together, the aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.

## Ethics In The Workplace

### [The code I’m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

"The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of" is a reflective article by Bill Sourour. In it he recounts his experience and regret for working on a project that was used to market pharmaceuticals to teenaged girls. Oftentimes, marketing uses under-handed tactics target the uninformed and vulnerable in the interest of selling a product to increase profits. While the author and their firm were not directly responsible for the creation and sale of the drug, they are still indirectly culpiable as participants in the delivery of the marketing campaign. I support the author's decision to resign from that role, and now be more mindful and considerate of the projects they choose to work on.

### [Big data is our generation’s civil rights issue, and we don’t know it](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/08/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it.html)

In the article "Big Data is Our Generation's Civil Rights Issue, and We Don't Know It," by Alistair Croll, the author highlights how the extensive collection and usage of big data can be used (is already used) to perpetuate systemic discrimination and inequality. It's important to recognize that access to and control over vast sums of data have become essential elements of individual freedom and empowerment in the digital age. We must acknowledge the potential risks of big data analytics, including privacy violations and biased algorithms, which can further reinforce social inequalites. Addressing these issues requires collective efforts from governments, corporations, and individuals to ensure fair and ethical data practices to protect the greater good.
