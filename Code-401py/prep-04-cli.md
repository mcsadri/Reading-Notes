  - Most commands have many useful command line options. Make sure you skim the man page for new commands so you are familiar with what they can do and what is available.
  - Man pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept.
  - Search man pages with `man -k <search term>`
    - Search within a manual page with forward slash `/` followed by the term, e.g. `/<term>` you would like to search for and hit `enter`. Use `n` to select the next search match.

  - Use `-p` and/or `-v` with `mkdir` to either make parent directories as needed, or have mkdir provide verbose output.
  - There is no undo when it comes to the command line
  - Use `cp` to copy file or a folder. Use `mv` to rename or move a file or folder.
