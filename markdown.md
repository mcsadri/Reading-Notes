# Code 102 - Day 1 notes

Learning to Learn:

- Growth mindset
- Demo & Lab

## How you will learn

Path learning (used for lectures):

- Leads you along
- Students are consumers of information
- Predictable outcomes
- Creates dependency
- The goal: an exchange of information

Sandbox learning (labs):

- Fosters exploration
- Students are co-creators of their own learning experience
- Wide range of outcomes - less predictability
- Creates autonomy
- The goal: learning and discovery
- Lots of failures create learning opportunity
- Tips:
  - Generating and selecting ideas: what do you want to learn?
  - Planning your learning: managing scope, finding resources
  - Experimentation: keeping track of what you've tried, what's worked, and what hasn't
  - Reflection: pausing every so often to tally what you've learned
  - Finding help!

What is mindset?

- Mindset: self-perception or "self-theory" that people hold about themselves
- Fixed mindset: believing basic qualities, like intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. Believing that talent alone creates success
- **Growth mindset: believing that people most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work - brain and talent are just the starting point.**

## Web publishing w/ github pages and Markdown

Why Markdown?

- It's its own language
- HTML give you significant control, but slows down authoring
- Web sites often exist primarily as a way to publish content

What is Markdown?

- Markdown is a light weight markup language for generating html files
- It is not a WYSIWYG editor like MS Word or Google Docs
- Instead it uses textual symbols to indicate the structure of the page

How do we Markdown?

- Github uses Markdown pretty much everywhere:
  1. Top level README.md files are auto-rendered
  2. Any other .md files
  3. Issues, comments, code reviews, etc.
- Github Pages will convert your Markdown, apply a theme and publish it
